Samson Race Dorfman
Graphics HW 1.3

Features:
1. Avatar control: Use w for gas and a and d to turn the car. The car should always move straight forwards the way it is pointing, unless you turn sharp enough to lose traction, in which case the car will drift until you let off the gas and/or countersteer.
2. Collisions: The car should collide with the rocks scattered on the course, which will not move, and the enemy car, which should move as well.
3. Texture animation: Press c to activate challenge mode. Now, instead of bouncing off obstacles, you will explode with a brief animation when you hit obstacles or the other vehicle.
4. Parenting: When you let off the gas at medium to high speeds, a flame parented to the car should quickly pop twice from the exhaust.
5. Spawn: When turning sharply enough to drift, a smoke trail will appear behind the vehicle and then quickly fade away.
6. AI: The enemy car will constantly race the course. It does so by steering itself towards 10 checkpoints throughout the track.
